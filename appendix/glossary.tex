Glossary
AXI: Advanced eXtensible Interface, commonly used bus for transferring data in embedded devices and smart phones.

MOPS: Multiplicity Of Positive Steps, a trigger type in the UUB.

PL: Programmable Logic, this is the firmware and logic features running on the FPGA portion of the Zynq\textsuperscript{TM} chip.

PPS, 1PPS: Pulse per Second or One Pulse Per Second, usually refers to the GPS synchronized pulse put out by a time standard such as an atomic clock or GPS receiver.

PS: Processing System, this is the half of the Zynq\textsuperscript{TM} chip that hosts the operating system and functions as a system-on-a-chip.

SEP: Spherical Error Probable, the radius from the mean of a collection of points within which 50\% of the points lie, used in GPS parlance.

TOT: Time Over Threshold, a type of trigger used in UHECR detectors.

UB: Unified Board, the original integrated electronic board for the Auger observatory, predecessor to the UUB.

UUB: Upgraded Unified Board, the board being fabricated for the AugerPrime upgrade. 

UHECR: Ultra High Energy Cosmic Ray, Cosmic rays with energies \textgreater 10$^{18}$ eV.

UART: Universal Asynchronous Transmitter/Receiver, the device which handles asynchronous communications, such as those for an RS-232 connection.

VCXO: Voltage Controlled Crystal Oscillator, and oscillator whose voltage is controlled by a changeable reference.
